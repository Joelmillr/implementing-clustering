# implementing-clustering

# Overview
In this assignment, you will be working with some age (measured in years) and height (measured in fractional feet. So, for instance, 5 feet 6 inches would be 5.5 since there are 12 inches in a foot). The data is admittedly made up, but I chose these interpretations to demonstrate something very important about clustering.
In the data, there is a feature called true_cluster. Usually, this column would never be available to you (after all, clustering is a form of unsupervised learning). Do not use this column in your clustering. This column has been included for the sole purpose of comparing clustering methods to ground truth.
